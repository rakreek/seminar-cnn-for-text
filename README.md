# Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification

An approximately 60-minute talk on CNNs and text classification, with a focus on visualization of your network's inner workings.

The slides are hosted here on [GitHub]().

Or if you have `jupyter` installed, you can build them yourself:
`$ jupyter nbconvert --to slides --reveal-prefix slide_resources/reveal.js-3.4.1 slides.ipynb`
